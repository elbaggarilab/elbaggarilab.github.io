## Overview

<br><em>Atomic-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy of low temperature trimers in a 2D material</em>


Strongly correlated electronic materials host a myriad of fascinating structural, electronic and magnetic ground states as well as complex behaviors
ranging from the nanoscale coexistence of competing phases to a huge sensitivity to external stimuli.
Our laboratory utilizes <em>in situ</em> electron microscopy to **visualize and manipulate these materials at the atomic scale**.

## Techniques

The instrument at the heart of our research is the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) which
provides vivid atomic-resolution images of crystalline materials. To access and manipulate the rich phases of
strongly correlated materials, both **ultra-stable cryogenic sample holders** and **<em>in situ</em> control knobs** are essential.

The advent of high-resolution cryogenic STEM imaging near 90 K has enabled unprecedented microscopic insights, such as the direct visualization of the picometer scale distortions that accompany [charge and orbital order](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24026-7), [topological defects](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/7/1445.shor) in stripes, and [trimerization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10445) in a 2D material.

Recently, we have developed a novel instrument that enables cooling using [liquid helium](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00636). The low-vibration design enables atomic-resolution imaging and stable temperature performance. A broad range of electronic, optical and quantum phases are now accessible to electron microscopy.

## Topics

The materials we study range from bulk complex oxides to atomically engineered heterointerfaces to quasi-2D
and quasi-1D compounds. These systems provide a rich playground for studying phenomena such as **charge and orbital order**,
**superconductivity**, **phase separation**, **ferroelectricity** and **quantum criticality**.

We are interested in understanding phase transitions by directly visualizing order and disorder.
Examples include real space [observations](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/7/1445.short) of topological defects in charge-ordered stripes, [atomic-scale tracking](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.15.011007) of charge order dislocations across temperatures, and discovering an [inverse transition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10445) in a chemically doped ferroelectric.
