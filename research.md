## Overview

![cryoSTEM](../img/cryoSTEM2.png)
<br><em>Atomic-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy</em>

Our laboratory utilizes <em>in situ</em> electron microscopy to visualize and understand quantum materials at the atomic scale.

These materials host a myriad of fascinating structural, electronic and magnetic ground states as well as complex behavior
ranging from the nanoscale coexistence of competing phases to a huge sensitivity to external stimuli.
These aspects call for novel experimental approaches that can visualize and manipulate quantum materials simultaneously.

<br/>
## Techniques
The instrument at the heart of our research is the (scanning) transmission electron microscope (STEM), which
provides vivid atomic-resolution images of crystalline materials. To access and manipulate the rich phases of
quantum materials, both **ultra-stable cryogenic sample holders** and **<em>in situ</em> control knobs are essential**.

High-resolution cryogenic STEM imaging near 90 K was recently demonstrated, and has enabled unprecedented microscopic insights
such as the direct visualization of the picometer scale distortions that accompany charge and orbital order.

In our lab, we strive to couple <em>in situ</em> and <em>ex situ</em> electrical excitation with cryogenic STEM imaging (down to liquid helium
temperatures). This will allow us to not only **correlate the atomic-scale insights
with the macroscopic electronic properties** but also to **drive quantum materials into novel states**.

## Topics
The materials we study range from bulk complex oxides to atomically engineered heterointerfaces to quasi-2D
and quasi-1D compounds. These systems are a rich playground for studying phenomena such as charge and orbital order,
superconductivity, phase separation, ferroelectricity and quantum criticality.

We are also interested in fundamentally understanding the nature of phase transitions by means of direct visualizations.
For example, we succeeded in seeing topological defects and phase fluctuations in charge order stripes and how they
alter long range ordering. 

Building on this, our lab will develop a platform to image non-equilibrium transitions and metastable
states driven by electrical current and/or light pulses.
