## Join our lab!

### Post-doctoral fellows
Our lab welcomes applications for a postdoctoral fellow position in the area of *in situ* scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) of quantum materials. We seek to visualize and control quantum phases of matter at the atomic scale using low temperature STEM coupled to *in situ* and *ex situ* electrical manipulation. This combination allows us to not only correlate atomic-scale insights with macroscopic electronic properties but also to induce novel phenomena in quantum materials. 

We invite motivated applicants with a strong background in high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and a demonstrated experience in the analysis of microscopy/spectroscopy data for uncovering novel phenomena. The ideal candidate has experience in *in situ* transmission electron microscopy techniques (biasing/heating/strain/cryogenic) or strong interest in cryogenics, transport characterization, or micro/nanofabrication. A PhD in physics, applied physics, materials science, or similar fields is required.

The candidate will work closely with the PI at the interdisciplinary Rowland Institute and engage with the broad quantum research community at Harvard University. Our lab has a dedicated *in situ* TEM holder for custom low temperature experiments, a cryogenic system for ex situ characterization of TEM devices, and a suite of sample preparation tools. We make use of microscopy facilities at the Harvard Center for Nanoscale Systems and MIT.nano including aberration-corrected STEM, focused ion beams, additional TEM holders, and nanofabrication.

To apply, please send the following to **ielbaggari@rowland.harvard.edu**
  1. a cover letter describing your past research and a future research project you might want to perform in our lab (2 pages max) 
  2. an academic CV
  3. contact information for 3 references


### Undergraduate students

Our group seeks to provide undergraduate students with engaging research projects in the field of experimental condensed matter physics. We have a position for an undergraduate student starting in Fall 2021. To discuss opportunities, contact ielbaggari@rowland.harvard.edu.
