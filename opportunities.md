### Postdocs

Our lab welcomes applications for a postdoctoral fellow position in the area of <em> in situ </em> scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) of quantum materials. 
We seek to visualize and control quantum phases of matter at the atomic scale using low temperature STEM coupled to <em>in situ</em> and <em>ex situ</em> electrical manipulation. This combination will allow us to not only correlate atomic-scale insights with macroscopic electronic properties but also to induce novel phenomena in quantum materials. We plan to investigate a variety of material platforms, from layered 2D chalcogenides to quasi-1D crystals to atomically engineered oxides and more. 

We invite applicants with (1) a strong background in high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, (2) experience in the analysis of 
microscopy/spectroscopy data for uncovering subtle phenomena, and (3) experience or strong interest in any of the following: 
strongly correlated electron systems and other quantum materials, <em>in situ </em> transmission electron microscopy techniques (biasing/heating/strain), cryogenics, transport characterization, or nanofabrication.

The candidate will benefit from close contact with the PI (Dr. Ismail El Baggari) at the interdisciplinary Rowland Institute and engagement with the broad quantum research community at Harvard University. Our lab has a dedicated <em>in situ</em> cryogenic/electrical TEM holder for custom low temperature experiments, a 1.5K/9T cryostat system for <em>ex situ</em> characterization of the same devices used in <em>in situ</em> STEM experiments, and a suite of sample preparation tools. For microscopy experiments, our group will use aberration-corrected electron microscopes, focused ion beams and other imaging tools located at the Harvard [Center for Nanoscale Systems](https://cns1.rc.fas.harvard.edu/).

To apply, please send the following to ielbaggari@rowland.harvard.edu 
* a cover letter describing your past research and a future research project you might want to perform  in our lab (2 pages max). This will serve a starting point for discussion.
* an academic CV  
* contact information for 2-3 references
