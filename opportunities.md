## Our lab is opening in mid-September 2020. The positions below are available.

**Postdocs**
Our group welcomes applications for a postdoctoral fellow position in the area of <em> in situ </em> scanning transmission electron microscopy of quantum materials. 

We invite applicants with a strong background in (1) high-resolution electron microscopy and electron energy loss 
spectroscopy of materials and (2) the analysis of microscopy/spectroscopy data to uncover subtle phenomena.
Experience or strong interest in any of the following fields is a plus: strongly correlated electron systems or other quantum materials, 
<em>in situ </em> electron microscopy techniques (biasing/heating/strain), cryogenics, transport characterization, or nanofabrication.

To apply, please send the following to ielbaggari@rowland.harvard.edu 
* a cover letter describing your past research and your future research interests (equivalent of 1 page)
* an academic CV  
* contact information for 2-3 references

**Undergraduate Students**
We aim to provide undergraduate students with meaningful research projects in the lab. Contact Ismail at ielbaggari@rowland.harvard.edu for more information. 

**Graduate Students**
Co-advised graduate student positions may be available, especially if you are interested in integrating atomic-resolution imaging into your research.
Contact Ismail at ielbaggari@rowland.harvard.edu to discuss.
