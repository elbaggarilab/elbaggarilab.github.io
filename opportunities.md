## University of British Columbia
In **January 2026**, the lab will move to the [Stewart Blusson Quantum Matter Institute](https://qmi.ubc.ca/) and [Department of Physics & Astronomy](https://www.phas.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC, Canada.

#### Post-doctoral scientists

Post-doctoral candidates with a strong background in experimental condensed matter physics, electron microscopy, spectroscopy, electron optics, and/or cryogenics are encouraged to apply by emailing **ismail.elbaggari [at] gmail.com**. 

Please include a CV, a 1-page proposal for future research, and contact information for 2 references. 

#### Graduate students
Prospective graduate students should visit the Department of Physics & Astronomy [Graduate Program Prospective Students](https://phas.ubc.ca/graduate-program-prospective-students) website to understand eligibility requirements and application timelines. 

Admitted and current students should contact Prof. El Baggari directly. UBC students should explore Graduate fellowship opportunities such as [QuEST](https://qmi.ubc.ca/programs/quest-program/), [NSERC Graduate Scholarships](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PG-CS/CGSM-BESCM_eng.asp) and [more](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/scholarships-awards-funding/award-opportunities).

#### Undergraduate students

Our group seeks to provide motivated undergraduate students with engaging research projects in the fields of experimental condensed matter physics, mechanical design of advanced instrumentation, and electronics.

Prospective undergraduate summer students should apply for an [Undergraduate Summer Research Award](https://phas.ubc.ca/undergraduate-summer-research-awards).
