We invite applicants with (1) a strong background in high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, (2) experience in the analysis of 
microscopy/spectroscopy data for uncovering subtle phenomena, and (3) experience or strong interest in any of the following: 
strongly correlated electron systems and other quantum materials, 
<em>in situ </em> transmission electron microscopy techniques (biasing/heating/strain), cryogenics, transport characterization,
or nanofabrication.
