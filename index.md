Our lab develops <em> in situ</em> cryogenic electron microscopy and in situ capabilities to visualize, understand and manipulate quantum materials at the atomic scale.
We are located at the <a href="https://www.rowland.harvard.edu/">Rowland Institute at Harvard</a> in Cambridge, MA.

## UPDATE
In **January 2026**, the lab will move to the [Stewart Blusson Quantum Matter Institute](https://qmi.ubc.ca/) and [Department of Physics & Astronomy](https://www.phas.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC, Canada. 

Positions will be available for post-doctoral scientists and current UBC graduate students. Prospective graduate students should first apply to the [MSc program](https://phas.ubc.ca/graduate-program-prospective-students) at UBC and, if admitted, contact Prof. El Baggari to explore positions.
