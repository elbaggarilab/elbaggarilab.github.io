A cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscope reveals the atomic-scale mechanism that disrupts the charge-ordered state in a manganite material. The visualizations were performed at the atomic scale and across variable temperatures. This work by Noah Schnitzer was published in [Physical Review X](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.15.011007).

A write-up about this work is also available in [Physics Magazine](https://physics.aps.org/articles/v18/10).
