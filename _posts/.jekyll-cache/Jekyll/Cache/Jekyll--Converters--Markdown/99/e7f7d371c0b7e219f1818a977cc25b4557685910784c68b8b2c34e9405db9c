I"7<p>Noah Schnitzer (Cornell) et al demonstrate the use of a cryogenic MEMS-based system that achieves intermediate cryogenic temeprature. This allows for the first time STEM imaging as a function of temperature, a key capability for understanding the evolution of order. Even more impressive, the results here show that we can track order on the exact same field of view, registered unit cell to unit cell. This allows tracking of topological defects in charge order and how they lead to melting of order at increased temperature. https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08580</p>
