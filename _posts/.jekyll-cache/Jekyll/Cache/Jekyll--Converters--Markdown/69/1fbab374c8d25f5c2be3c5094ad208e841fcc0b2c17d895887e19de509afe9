I"M<p>Our team has been working on a novel design that enables liquid helium cooling inside of the electron microscope. This long-sought capability is key to accessing quantum phenomena but had proven difficult to achieve. Using a novel design, we demonstrate ultra-cold TEM performance (23 K), impressive millikelvin temperature stability, and low vibrations that enable atomic resolution TEM imaging. 
This project involved key contributors including Emily Rennich, Suk Hyun Sung, Nishkarsh Agarwal, Maya Gates, Robert Kerns, and Robert Hovden.
Moreover, this project involved key insights and expertise from Winfield Hill, Erik Madsen, Kal Banger, Alan Stern and
Chris Stokes at the Rowland Institute at Harvard. 
We also received immense help from Tao Ma,Haiping Sun, and Allen Hunter at the Michigan Center for Materials Characterization.</p>
