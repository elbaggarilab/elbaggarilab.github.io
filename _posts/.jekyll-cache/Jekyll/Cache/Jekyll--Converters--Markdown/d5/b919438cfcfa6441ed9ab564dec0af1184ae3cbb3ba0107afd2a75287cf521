I"ö<p>Our team has been working on a novel design that enables liquid helium cooling inside transmission electron microscopes. This long-sought capability is key to accessing quantum phenomena but had proven difficult to achieve. Using a novel design, we demonstrate ultra-cold TEM performance (23 K), impressive millikelvin temperature stability, and low vibrations that enable atomic resolution TEM imaging.
